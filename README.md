# HouseKit
HouseKit is a House Furniture Website created to test my early skills with HTML and CSS!
This website is still under early development, but it contains basic HTML and CSS features such as nesting, grids, flexboxes, and a modern-styled UI.

I intend to update this website frequently, and maybe (just maybe) modify it by giving it some JavaScript to make it responsive as well!
