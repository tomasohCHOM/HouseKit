# HouseKit
HouseKit is a House Furniture Website created to test my early skills with HTML and CSS.
This website is still under development, but it contains basic HTML and CSS features such as nesting, grids, flexboxes, and a modern-styled UI.
## Preview of the Homepage:

Missing features, such as responsiveness and overall interactivity with JavaScript, may be implemented in the feature.
## Update (5/22/2023):
It now includes a Login page, as seen below:

## Update (5/31/2023):

A toggable navbar is now added to HouseKit. JavaScript handles the navbar, which makes it so that we don't have to implement it multiple times for each HTML file, effectively applying the DRY principle (Don't Repeat Yourself).
I also attempted to make the page responsive, but realized it works better in some screens than others. Will probably work on that next.
